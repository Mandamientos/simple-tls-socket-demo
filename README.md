# üîê Simple TLS Socket Demo

A minimal example of a secure TLS connection using Python's built-in `ssl` and `socket` libraries.  
This project includes a simple **TLS server** and **TLS client**, secured with self-signed certificates.

‚ö†Ô∏è This was made for Linux, the process to get the certificates may differ on Windows.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-tls-socket-demo.git
cd simple-tls-socket-demo
```

### 2. Generate self-signed certificates

‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful, when prompted for the CN (Common Name), enter: `localhost`

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

### Files Overview

- `server.py`
- `client.py`
- `cert.pem`
- `key.pem`

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the example

In one terminal, start the server:
```bash
python3 server.py
```

In another terminal, run the client:
```bash
python3 server.py
```
